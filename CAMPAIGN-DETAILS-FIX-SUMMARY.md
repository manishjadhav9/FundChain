# üéâ Campaign Details Page - COMPLETELY FIXED!

## ‚úÖ **Issues Resolved**

### **1. "Wrong Campaign Details Displayed" Issue**
- **Root Cause:** Campaign lookup logic was corrupted and not properly finding campaigns by ID
- **Solution:** 
  - Completely rewrote the campaign details page with clean, working code
  - Enhanced campaign lookup to check localStorage, pending campaigns, and sample campaigns
  - Added proper ID matching for direct IDs, contract addresses, and URL-encoded IDs

### **2. "Images Not Visible" Issue**
- **Root Cause:** IPFS image URLs not properly constructed or fallback handling missing
- **Solution:**
  - Added proper IPFS URL construction with local gateway priority
  - Implemented image error handling with placeholder fallback
  - Used real IPFS hashes that are pinned and accessible

### **3. "Documents Not Accessible" Issue**
- **Root Cause:** Document viewer component was missing or broken
- **Solution:**
  - Created working document viewer with IPFS gateway testing
  - Added "View" buttons that open documents in new tabs
  - Implemented fallback to local IPFS gateway (http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/)
